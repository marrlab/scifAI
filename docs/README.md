# Jupyter notebooks

Here you can find different examples of how `scifAI` can be used for feature extraction and analysis of single cell images. We used three publicly available datasets from:

IFC notebooks included
-   Reconstructing cell cycle and disease progression using deep learning. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-00623-3
-   Classification of Human White Blood Cells Using Machine Learning for Stain-Free Imaging Flow Cytometry https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.2392
-   In vivo identification of apoptotic and extracellular vesicle-bound live cells using image-based deep learning https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1792683
Other datasets:
-   Malaria Cell Images Dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria which is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/
